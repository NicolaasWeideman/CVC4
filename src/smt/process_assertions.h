 * Module in charge of processing assertions for an SMT engine.
 *
 * Its main features are:
 * (1) apply(AssertionsPipeline&), which updates the assertions based on our
 * preprocessing steps,
 * (2) expandDefinitions(TNode, ...), which returns the expanded formula of a
 * term.
 * The method finishInit(...) must be called before these methods are called.
 *
 * It is designed to be agnostic to whether we are in incremental mode. That is,
 * it processes assertions in a way that assumes that apply(...) could be
 * applied multiple times to different sets of assertions.
